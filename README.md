## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS & Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I learned how to use parent & child selectors in javascript, I also learned how to use HTML _details_ & _summary_ elements, but I didn't implement it in this project as I was not aware of styling the default arrow that comes with _summary_ element.

### Continued development

I will definitely try to understand how to use custom styles for _summary_ & _details_ HTML elements and implement them in my future projects where it is necessary.
